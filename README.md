# 230-Final_Project

# Solo/Leader - Austin Shelton
# Will be doing everything

# Idea:

# The Book Collection Web App is a sleek, user-friendly platform for readers to organize and explore their personal libraries online. Users can register, log in, and add books with details like title, author, and genre. 
# Built with Bootstrap for a modern, responsive design, the app uses flat-file storage for simplicity and speed. Readers can browse and search books, while admins manage users and content—forming a strong foundation for a future, database-powered capstone project.
